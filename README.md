Simulation Code and Data
The folder pValueThresholdSim contains a pdf manuscript, 3 R scripts, and 3 folders.

  pValResearchSimBaselineCase.R performs 100 monte carlo replicates of the baseline case as discussed in the pdf manuscript.
  timeSeriesAndHistogramsBaselineCase.R generates graphs to illustrate the data generated by the above simulation
  timeSeriesAndHistogramsThreeCases.R generates graphs that compare different simulation outputs
  each folder contains simulation codes for three cases and Rdata files for three cases for simulations discussed in the pdf.
